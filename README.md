## :star: **React Concepts Learned** 

Through this project, the following key React concepts and techniques were learned and applied:

**Component-Based Architecture**: The application is built using React's component-based architecture, breaking down the UI into reusable components.

**State Management**: Utilized React's useState hook to manage the state of the to-do list and individual tasks.

**Props**: Passed data between components using props, allowing for dynamic and flexible component behavior.

**Event Handling**: Implemented event handlers to manage user interactions such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks.

**Forms and Controlled Components**: Managed form inputs using controlled components to handle user input and form submission.

**Conditional Rendering**: Used conditional rendering to display different UI elements based on the application state.

**List Rendering**: Rendered lists of tasks dynamically by mapping over arrays of data.

**CSS Styling**: Applied CSS to style the components, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
